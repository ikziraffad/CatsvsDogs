# Cats vs Dogs Classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained to classify images of cats and dogs. The model is built using Python and TensorFlow, and it is capable of distinguishing between images of cats and dogs with high accuracy.

# Dataset

The training data consists of a large collection of labeled images of cats and dogs. The dataset used for training and evaluation is the well-known Dogs vs. Cats dataset from Kaggle. The dataset is split into a training set and a validation set to assess the model's performance.
